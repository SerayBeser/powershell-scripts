##### LONG DESCRIPTION	

Send-PhishingMail Program sends phishing mail to the 
destination mail address(es). By default, there is a phishing mail in the program. However, 
if you want to send another mail, you can do it with the -operation flag. <manuel> takes the 
subject and the body from the user and sends it to the destination address(es). The program 
has the ability to send mail to many people at the same time by using -to flag. (-to can get 
a list) The program also allows you to send mail in html format at the same time. For this, 
it is enough to mark the -isbodyHtml flag as true by taking the html formatted text's path 
with the -bodyPath flag. Use the -attachmentPath flag to attach an attachment to the e-mail.
